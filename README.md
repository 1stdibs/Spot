#Spot

Simple Spotify-powered tunes for your office.

##Origins

This project is heavily inspired by [Play](https://github.com/play/play). Which is an awesome iTunes-based solution.

##Requirements

*   OS X
*   Spotify > 0.8
*   Campfire with Hubot (optional but recommended)

##Setup

Install [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com).

Clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/minton/Spot.git && cd Spot

Install gems:

    bundle install

Start Spot:

    rake start

The server will start up here: [localhost:5051](http://localhost:5051).

Spotify will open and `Repeat` and `Shuffle` will be turned on.

You should now open your favorite playlist or radio station.
